# Blender add-on for 3MF
Import/Export 3MF files in Blender

The 3MF format is a modern alternative to old STL format for 3D printing.

## Fork

This is based on the [Blender3mfFormat](https://github.com/Ghostkeeper/Blender3mfFormat) add-on by Ghostkeeper. The goal is to make it functional for the recent Blender versions and to use the extension format.
